# March 2018 Board fix
Once we assembled the boards based on the initial design, we found we were unble to communicate with the board, and so could not even install a boot loader. 

Our initial fix was to put the analog circuit onto a separate board that we could plug into an Arduino. The objective was to just get *something* working so we could demonstrate it to people.

After the switch to the Arduino in early March 2018, the circuit still didn't work, so we brought it to a local electronic engineer, who diagnosed and fixed the problem. The results of that investigation are in this directory.
